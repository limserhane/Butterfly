# Butterfly Logging Library
  
Butterfly is another `c++` logging library.  

It's still in development.  

Butterfly is designed to be ergonomic and powerful, not extra-performant.  

## Platform & Requirements & Installation

This library uses `c++17` standard only. It is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS.  

Butterfly is developped to be used as a static library (not as a shared library or a header-only).

The provided makefile compiles the library for Linux systems only.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/limserhane/Butterfly.git
$ cd Butterfly/
$ make
```
Grab the `bin/libbutterfly.a` static library and the `include/butterfly/` include folder and add them to your project.
